# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the goodlab infrastructure.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

We use the format proposed by Michael Nygard in his article:

- **Title**: Short, descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change we're actually proposing or have agreed to
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult as a result

## Naming Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially and formatted as:

```
NNNN-title-with-dashes.md
```

Example: `0001-clawdbot-gateway-deployment.md`

## Index

- [ADR-0001](0001-clawdbot-gateway-deployment.md) - Clawdbot Gateway Deployment Location
